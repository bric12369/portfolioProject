# My First Portfolio Website #

This is my first attempt at a portfolio website to showcase a little information about myself, along with some examples of my work. As I develop and work on more projects, I plan to keep this site up to date.

# Features #
- Header/Nav - This section contains my name and some links to help navigate users to different areas of the page. This section contains a hamburger menu on smaller devices, allowing user to toggle the menu open and closed as they wish.
- About Me section - This section contains a photo of me, along with some text about me and my goals. I have also included a button where users can download my CV.
- Projects section - This section contains screenshots of some of my projects, along with an explanation of their purpose.
- Contact section - This section contains 3 images, each of which will link users directly to my email, GitHub account and LinkedIn account, respectively. I used "target: _blank" to open these in new pages.
- Footer - This section contains another nav with links to the rest of the page.

## Technologies ##
- HTML was used to build the structure and contents of the webpage.
- CSS was used to style the webpage and make it responsive to different screen sizes using media queries.
- JavaScript was used to create an onclick function allowing users to access the hamburger menu on screens with smaller widths.
