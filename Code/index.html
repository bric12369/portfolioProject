                <p>
                    Hi, my name is Barry and I'm an aspiring web developer with a passion for creating intuitive
                    and visually appealing websites. For the past six months, I've been dedicated to learning web
                    development, building a foundation in coding and design that I'm excited to expand further.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Currently, I work as a Credentialing and Registrations Coordinator for a Teleradiology company.
                    In this role, I've developed strong organisational skills, attention to detail, and the ability
                    to manage complex processes - qualities I'm eager to bring into my work as a web designer.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Transitioning into web design allows me to combine my creativity with technical problem-solving, 
                    crafting digital experiences that are both functional and engaging. This portfolio is a 
                    reflection of my journey so far, and I'm eager to continue growing and connecting with others
                    who share my passion for design and development.
                </p>
